                <h1>Hi everyone and welcome to the T-Shape course!</h1>
                <p>
                    This is a breif introduction where I'll provide you with some information about that course.
                    So, T-Shape is a course (mostly for Java developers) that includes two big parts - <strong>T-Shape Engineer articles</strong> and <strong>T-Shape Engineer project</strong>.
                    Plus, this small web page which you can use as a navigation tool to get through the course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the first part of the T-Shape course (<strong>T-Shape Engineer articles</strong>) I would like to share my knowledge with you about backend and frontend.
                    As I'm a Java developer the main language will be Java. We will talk about Java itself, computer sience, network programming, patterns, architecture, microservices, security.
                    Regarding frontend there will be JavaScript and some of the frameworks such as VueJS and ReactJS, PWA (Progressive Web Apps), DevOps, and so on.
                    I will try to organise all these stuff in the understandable and accessible form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second part is more like a phisical representation of the first part, we will create a project called <strong>"Mister Keeper"</strong>.
                    The whole process of creation of this project is based on knowledge shared in the first part, so step by step, article by article <strong>"Mister Keeper"</strong> will be creating from scratch.
                    <strong>"Mister Keeper"</strong> is a web application where you can keep information about books, music, movies, games.
                    Searching, rating, reviewing, sharing information with you friends and so on (it's kind of social network). All in one place.
                    <strong>"Mister Keeper"</strong> has two parts: Backend part (the source code is <a href="https://github.com/Ghost-Rider-gu/Mister-Keeper" target="_blank">here</a>)
                    and Frontend part (the source code is <a href="https://github.com/Ghost-Rider-gu/Mister-Keeper-UI" target="_blank">here</a>)
                </p>
                <p>
                    The last but not least this <strong>"navigation" tool</strong>. You can consider it as a starting point to start your journey.
                    I hope it will help you go through the articles and see the whole picture of the course.
                    You can start from the current small description then take a look at the T-Shape Engineer schema - it's a diagram where depicts all topics that will be covered.
                    Maybe I will extend it in near future with new interesting topics.
                    The last thing it's T-Shape Engineer articles - also a diagram with links to the specific article on <a href="https://dzone.com" target="_blank">DZone.com</a> portal.
                    This diagram will be growing with every new article published on DZone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, basically that's all. I wish you all the best and take care!
