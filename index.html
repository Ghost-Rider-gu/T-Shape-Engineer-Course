                <h1>Hi everyone and welcome to the T-Shape course!</h1>
                <p>
                    This is a brief introduction where I'll provide you with some information about that course.
                    So, T-Shape is a course (mostly for Java developers) that includes two big parts - <strong>T-Shape Engineer articles</strong> and <strong>T-Shape Engineer project</strong>.
                    Plus, this small web page you can use as a navigation tool to get through the course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the first part of the T-Shape course (<strong>T-Shape Engineer articles</strong>) I would like to share my knowledge with you about back-end and front-end.
                    As I'm a Java developer the main language will be Java. We will talk about Java itself, computer science, network programming, patterns, architecture, microservices, and security.
                    Regarding the front-end there will be JavaScript (native JS), Vue.js, React, PWA (Progressive Web Apps), DevOps, and so on.
                    I will try to organize all this stuff in an understandable and accessible form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second part is more like a physical representation of the first part, we will create a project called <strong>"Mister Keeper"</strong>.
                    The whole process of creation of this project is based on knowledge shared in the first part, so step by step, article by article <strong>"Mister Keeper"</strong> will be created from scratch.
                    <strong>"Mister Keeper"</strong> is a web application where you can keep information about books, music, movies, and games.
                    Searching, rating, reviewing, sharing information with your friends, and so on (it's a kind of a social network). All in one place.
                    <strong>"Mister Keeper"</strong> has two parts: the back-end part (the source code is <a href="https://github.com/Ghost-Rider-gu/Mister-Keeper" target="_blank">here</a>)
                    and the front-end part (the source code is <a href="https://github.com/Ghost-Rider-gu/Mister-Keeper-UI" target="_blank">here</a>)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last but not least this <strong>"navigation"</strong> tool. You can consider it as a starting point to start your journey.
                    I hope it will help you to go through the articles and see the whole picture of the course.
                    You can start from the current small description and then take a look at the T-Shape Engineer schema - it's a diagram that depicts all topics that will be covered.
                    Maybe I will extend it in near future with new interesting topics.
                    The last thing, it's the T-Shape Engineer articles - also a diagram with links to the specific article on <a href="https://dzone.com" target="_blank">DZone.com</a> portal.
                    This diagram will be growing with every new article published on DZone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's all. I wish you all the best and take care!
                </p>
