# T-Shape Engineer Course

Hi everyone,
This is a small web page for introduction and navigating through the **T-Shape Engineer course**.

I will continue working on this page: *updating diagrams with the topics and articles to keep them up to date*.
   
You can check how it looks right now [here](https://ghost-rider-gu.github.io/T-Shape-Engineer-Course/)  

What I'm using for that small web page:
 - ***Plain JavaScript***
 - ***CSS***
 - ***HTML***
 - ***[D3.js](https://d3js.org/) library***
 - ***Plugin for D3.js library - [D3 Mitch Tree](https://github.com/deltoss/d3-mitch-tree)***
